# slack-network-experiments
The directories hashtag_game_multiplayer and hashtag_game_individual contain software for network-based group interaction experiments. Both experiments are designed as asynchronous research tools built on Slack’s API, recreating the Hashtag Game from Dr. Priniski’s network experiments.

The Slack app chatbot delivers prompts to participants, records user input automatically, and facilitates asynchronous participation to emulate a more natural messaging or game-like environment. Despite this realism, the system maintains strict experimental control over network pairings and timing to ensure data validity and reproducibility.
