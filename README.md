# slack-network-experiments
The directories hashtag_game_multiplayer and hashtag_game_individual contain software for network-based group interaction experiments. Both experiments are designed as asynchronous research tools built on Slack’s API, recreating the Hashtag Game from [Dr. Priniski’s network experiments](https://github.com/jpriniski/NetCom/blob/main/Network%20Structure%20Experiments/Network%20Experiment%20Software/README.md
).

The Slack app chatbot delivers prompts to participants, records user input automatically, and facilitates asynchronous participation to emulate a more natural messaging or game-like environment. Despite this being more representative of online communities, the system maintains strict experimental control over network pairings and timing to ensure data validity and reproducibility.
